# Geographic data analysis and visualization

This repository contains some Python test code to analyze and visualize geographic data.

Analyses of geographic example data (see [data](data) directory) are presented in the form of Python Jupyter Notebooks that are best viewed online using [Jupyter nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/), which has improved display rendering capabilities compared to Github:
